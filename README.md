# Fibonacci-Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. It starts with 0 and 1, and continues as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.

This app (written in Golang) demonstrates how to calculate these numbers, and track them, using some basic Data Structures.
